## Introduction

GitHub is the backbone of many organizations‚Äô development lifecycle. But without hardened **access control** and **secrets management**, it quickly becomes the weakest link in your DevSecOps chain.  

This post provides practical best practices with **real CLI, API, and Terraform configurations**, showing how to build a GitHub org security baseline that can scale.

---

## What is Access Control in GitHub Organizations?

At its core, **access control** is about answering one simple question:

üëâ *‚ÄúWho is allowed to do what inside my GitHub organization?‚Äù*

GitHub provides multiple layers of access control that work together. Think of it like doors in a building ‚Äî some people can only enter the lobby, some can access specific floors, and only a few hold the master keys.

### üîë Key Building Blocks

* **Organization Roles**

  * **Owner** ‚Üí Full control over everything (like a root account). Use sparingly.
  * **Member** ‚Üí Default role for most developers. Can only access what they‚Äôre explicitly given.
  * **Security Manager** ‚Üí Focused on security settings (e.g., reviewing alerts, managing security policies).
  * **Billing Manager** ‚Üí Handles payments and billing, no code access.

* **Teams**

  * Group members logically (by project, product, function, or environment).
  * Assign repository permissions at the *team level* rather than per individual.
  * Example: a **DevOps team** with write access to CI/CD repos, and a **Security team** with admin access only where needed.

* **Repository Permissions**
  Each repo has fine-grained roles:

  * **Read** ‚Üí View only.
  * **Triage** ‚Üí Manage issues/PRs without changing code.
  * **Write** ‚Üí Push commits, merge PRs.
  * **Maintain** ‚Üí Manage repo settings without full admin.
  * **Admin** ‚Üí Full control over the repository.

* **Outside Collaborators**

  * Non-members who get access to specific repositories.
  * Useful for contractors, but risky if unmanaged.
  * Best practice: limit and review regularly.

* **Machine Identities**

  * **GitHub Apps** ‚Üí Best for automation; scoped to specific repos/orgs.
  * **Fine-grained PATs (Personal Access Tokens)** ‚Üí Safer than classic PATs; scope down to minimum rights.
  * **Actions GITHUB\_TOKEN** ‚Üí Auto-generated per workflow run; safest for CI/CD.
  * **OIDC (OpenID Connect)** ‚Üí Recommended for connecting GitHub Actions to cloud providers without storing secrets.

---

### üö´ Common Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

* Giving every team **Write** access ‚Äújust in case.‚Äù
* Using **classic PATs with broad scopes** instead of fine-grained tokens or OIDC.
* Assuming **private repos hide secrets** ‚Äî secrets should never be in code.
* Making too many **Owners** instead of limiting to a small, trusted set.
* Leaving **outside collaborators** with lingering repo access after contracts end.

---

## Designing Teams and Roles for Least Privilege

**Practical patterns:**
- Create teams by function (`backend`, `frontend`, `devops`, `security`) and map them to repos.  
- Apply `triage` or `read` where possible; grant `write` only where necessary.  
- Use `CODEOWNERS` to enforce reviews on sensitive code paths.  
- Disable repo forking in sensitive repos.  
- Audit owners and privileged roles monthly.

**Example: GitHub CLI**
```bash
# Add a user to Security team
gh api -X PUT \
  /orgs/ORG/teams/security/memberships/<USERNAME> \
  -f role=member
````

---

## Enforcement: 2FA, SSO, and Branch Protection

* **Require 2FA** for all members ([GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-two-factor-authentication-for-your-organization/requiring-two-factor-authentication-in-your-organization)).
* **Enforce SAML SSO** with your IdP to centralize access control.
* **Branch protection rules**: Require pull request reviews, enforce status checks, and enable required linear history.
* **CODEOWNERS**: Ensure sensitive paths (infra code, deployment scripts) require review by security/ops teams.

---

## Automating Access Control with CLI, API, and Terraform

Manual changes don‚Äôt scale. Use automation.

**Terraform example**

```hcl
resource "github_team" "devops" {
  name        = "devops"
  privacy     = "closed"
}

resource "github_repository" "ci_cd_tools" {
  name       = "ci-cd-tools"
  visibility = "private"
}

resource "github_team_repository" "devops_binding" {
  team_id    = github_team.devops.id
  repository = github_repository.ci_cd_tools.name
  permission = "push"
}
```

**REST API example** (Audit membership):

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
     https://api.github.com/orgs/ORG/teams/devops/members
```

---

## Secrets Management Best Practices

Secrets are the top source of breaches in GitHub orgs.

**Do this:**

* Enable **secret scanning** and **push protection** across all repos.
* Use **org and environment secrets** with scope minimization.
* Rotate secrets every 90 days (automate where possible).
* Never store secrets in private repos assuming ‚Äúnobody will see them.‚Äù

**Example workflow using secrets**

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    secrets: inherit
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Configure AWS creds
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
        with:
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
```

---

## Using OIDC Instead of Static Secrets

Replace static cloud keys with **short-lived credentials via OIDC**.

**AWS OIDC example**

```yaml
permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: read

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Configure AWS creds via OIDC
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
        with:
          role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/GitHubActionsRole
          aws-region: eu-central-1
```

This eliminates static keys in GitHub entirely.

---

## Auditing and Monitoring with the Audit Log API

Audit logs are your detection layer. Export and monitor them.

**Example: Get last 100 audit events**

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
     "https://api.github.com/orgs/ORG/audit-log?per_page=100&include=web,repo,team"
```

Feed logs into your SIEM, alert on changes like:

* New org owners added.
* New PATs created with broad scopes.
* Secrets added/removed.

---

## Security Baseline Checklist

* [ ] Require **2FA** for all members.
* [ ] Enforce **SSO** with IdP.
* [ ] Limit **Owners** ‚Äî only 2‚Äì3 per org.
* [ ] Automate team/repo permissions with Terraform.
* [ ] Enforce **branch protection + CODEOWNERS**.
* [ ] Enable **secret scanning & push protection** org-wide.
* [ ] Replace static keys with **OIDC**.
* [ ] Audit org roles + secrets monthly.
* [ ] Export **audit logs** daily into a SIEM.

---

## Conclusion

GitHub org security isn‚Äôt just a setting ‚Äî it‚Äôs a continuous practice. By combining **least privilege**, **secrets hygiene**, and **automation**, DevSecOps teams can prevent common mistakes that attackers routinely exploit.
