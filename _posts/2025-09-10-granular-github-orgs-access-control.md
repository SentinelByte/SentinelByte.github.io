## Introduction

GitHub is the backbone of many organizations‚Äô development lifecycle. But without hardened **access control** and **secrets management**, it quickly becomes the weakest link in your DevSecOps chain.  

This post provides practical best practices with **real CLI, API, and Terraform configurations**, showing how to build a GitHub org security baseline that can scale.

---

## What is Access Control in GitHub Organizations?

At its core, **access control** is about answering one simple question:

üëâ *‚ÄúWho is allowed to do what inside my GitHub organization?‚Äù*

GitHub provides multiple layers of access control that work together. Think of it like doors in a building ‚Äî some people can only enter the lobby, some can access specific floors, and only a few hold the master keys.

### üîë Key Building Blocks

* **Organization Roles**
  * **Owner** ‚Üí Full control (root-level access). Use sparingly.
  * **Member** ‚Üí Default role for most developers.
  * **Security Manager** ‚Üí Security-focused visibility.
  * **Billing Manager** ‚Üí Manages billing, no code access.

* **Teams**
  * Group members logically (project, function, environment).
  * Assign repo permissions at the *team* level, not per user.

* **Repository Permissions**
  * **Read** ‚Üí View only.  
  * **Triage** ‚Üí Manage issues/PRs without code changes.  
  * **Write** ‚Üí Push commits, merge PRs.  
  * **Maintain** ‚Üí Manage repo settings.  
  * **Admin** ‚Üí Full repo control.  

* **Outside Collaborators**
  * Direct repo access without org membership. Useful for contractors, but risky if unmanaged.  

* **Machine Identities**
  * **GitHub Apps** (preferred), **fine-grained PATs**, **Actions GITHUB_TOKEN**, and **OIDC** (recommended for cloud access).

---

### üö´ Common Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

- Giving every team **Write** access ‚Äújust in case.‚Äù  
- Using **classic PATs with broad scopes**.  
- Storing secrets inside private repos.  
- Assigning too many **Owners**.  
- Forgetting to remove **outside collaborators** after contracts end.  

---

## üöÄ GitHub Org Security Playbook (Step-by-Step)

If you‚Äôre starting with a **brand new GitHub org**, here‚Äôs a practical workflow you can follow.

### 1. Initial Org Setup
- Enforce **2FA** for all users.  
- Require **SSO** (Enterprise) for central IdP control.  
- Limit **Owners** to 2‚Äì3 trusted people.  
- Assign a **Security Manager** role for oversight.  

### 2. Team & Role Design
- Create functional teams (`backend`, `frontend`, `devops`, `security`).  
- Map repos to teams, not individuals.  
- Use least privilege ‚Üí e.g., devs = `write`, security team = `admin` only where needed.  

### 3. Repository Hardening
- Apply **branch protection rules** (reviews, status checks, no force-push).  
- Enforce **CODEOWNERS** for critical repos.  
- Disable repo forking for sensitive projects.  

### 4. Secrets & Machine Identities
- **Ban classic PATs**; enforce fine-grained PATs or OIDC.  
- Store secrets in org/repo secrets, not in code.  
- Rotate secrets regularly (ideally automated).  

### 5. Automation
- Use **Terraform GitHub Provider** to codify org/repo setup.  
- Run **GitHub CLI/API** audits for quick checks.  
- Detect drift between Terraform config and actual org state.  

### 6. Monitoring & Audit
- Export audit logs daily (API ‚Üí SIEM).  
- Alert on new owners, PAT creation, or external collaborator additions.  
- Do **quarterly access reviews** with team leads.  

---

## Designing Teams and Roles for Least Privilege

- Create teams by function (`backend`, `frontend`, `devops`, `security`).  
- Apply `triage` or `read` where possible.  
- Grant `write` only where absolutely needed.  
- Use `CODEOWNERS` to enforce reviews.  
- Audit **owners/admins** monthly.  

**CLI Example**:
```bash
gh api -X PUT \
  /orgs/ORG/teams/security/memberships/<USERNAME> \
  -f role=member
````

---

## Enforcement: 2FA, SSO, and Branch Protection

* **Require 2FA** ([GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-two-factor-authentication-for-your-organization/requiring-two-factor-authentication-in-your-organization))
* **Enforce SAML SSO** to your IdP.
* **Branch protections**: PR reviews, status checks, linear history.
* **CODEOWNERS**: sensitive paths require explicit review.

---

## Automating Access Control with CLI, API, and Terraform

Manual clicks don‚Äôt scale. Automation ensures **consistency, auditability, and compliance**.

### What We Want to Achieve

* **Codify policies** (no tribal knowledge).
* **Prevent privilege creep**.
* **Enable fast onboarding/offboarding**.
* **Demonstrate compliance** (‚Äúwho has access to what‚Äù).

### Tools

* **GitHub CLI (`gh`)** ‚Üí scripting and audits.
* **REST/GraphQL API** ‚Üí deeper integrations.
* **Terraform GitHub Provider** ‚Üí codify org/repo config in Git, use PR reviews for changes.

**Example: Terraform team + repo assignment**

```hcl
resource "github_team" "security" {
  name        = "security"
  description = "Security team"
}

resource "github_team_repository" "security_repo_access" {
  team_id    = github_team.security.id
  repository = "critical-service"
  permission = "admin"
}
```

---

## Secrets Management Best Practices

* Enable **secret scanning + push protection** org-wide.
* Use **org/environment secrets** with narrow scopes.
* Rotate secrets every 90 days (automate if possible).
* Never rely on private repos for secret storage.

---

## Using OIDC Instead of Static Secrets

Replace static cloud credentials with **short-lived OIDC tokens**.

**AWS Example**

```yaml
permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: read

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Configure AWS creds via OIDC
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
        with:
          role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/GitHubActionsRole
          aws-region: eu-central-1
```

---

## Auditing and Monitoring with the Audit Log API

**Get last 100 audit events**

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
     "https://api.github.com/orgs/ORG/audit-log?per_page=100&include=web,repo,team"
```

Monitor for:

* New org owners.
* PATs with broad scopes.
* Outside collaborator additions.

---

## Security Baseline Checklist

* [ ] Enforce **2FA** and **SSO**
* [ ] Limit Owners to 2‚Äì3 max
* [ ] Codify permissions with Terraform
* [ ] Apply **branch protection + CODEOWNERS**
* [ ] Enable **secret scanning** org-wide
* [ ] Replace static keys with **OIDC**
* [ ] Audit roles & secrets monthly
* [ ] Export audit logs daily

---

## Conclusion

GitHub org security isn‚Äôt a one-time setup ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **continuous process**. By combining **least privilege, secrets hygiene, and automation**, DevSecOps teams can stay ahead of attackers and scale securely.
