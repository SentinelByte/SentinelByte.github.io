# Terraform From zero to Hero + Complete Commands Cheat Sheet

If you’ve ever manually clicked through a cloud console to create servers, databases, or networks, you know it can get messy fast. What if you need to replicate the same environment tomorrow—or share it with your team? That’s where **Terraform** comes in.

This post is your **from zero to hero guide**:

* I’ll explain what Terraform is, why it’s important, and how it works.
* Walk step by step through writing and applying your first configuration.
* Cover intermediate concepts like variables, outputs, state, and modules.
* Wrap up with a **complete cheat sheet** you can use every day.

## 🌍 What is Terraform (and why should you care)?

Terraform is an **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** tool.
Instead of manually creating resources in AWS, Azure, GCP, or other providers, you describe your infrastructure in **declarative configuration files**.

* *Declarative* means: you describe **what you want**, not the step-by-step instructions to get there.
* Terraform then compares your desired state with the current state and figures out the actions needed (create, update, delete).

### Example Analogy

Imagine you’re telling a builder:

* “I want a house with 3 rooms, 2 bathrooms, and a garden.”
* You don’t explain *how* to lay bricks or install pipes.
* Terraform is that builder—it knows the steps and makes sure reality matches your blueprint.

## 🏗️ How Terraform Works (The 4-Step Workflow)

Terraform’s workflow always revolves around four core commands:

1. **Write** – You write configuration files (`.tf`) describing resources.
2. **Init** – Terraform downloads the right provider plugins.
3. **Plan** – Terraform shows you what will change.
4. **Apply** – Terraform makes those changes.

At the end, you can **destroy** everything with a single command.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started with Terraform

### Step 1. Install Terraform

Download Terraform from [HashiCorp’s official site](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads).

Check installation:

```bash
terraform -v
```

---

### Step 2. Set Up Your First Project

Create a new folder and a file called `main.tf`.

Inside `main.tf`, write:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "demo" {
  bucket = "my-terraform-demo-bucket-12345"
  acl    = "private"
}
```

**What this does:**

* **Provider block:** tells Terraform which cloud provider you’re using (here AWS).
* **Resource block:** describes the thing you want (an S3 bucket).
* Each resource has a **type** (`aws_s3_bucket`) and a **name** (`demo`).

---

### Step 3. Initialize Terraform

```bash
terraform init
```

This downloads the **provider plugin** (AWS in this case) into a hidden folder `.terraform/`.

Without `init`, Terraform doesn’t know how to talk to AWS.

---

### Step 4. Validate Configuration

```bash
terraform validate
```

Checks for typos and syntax errors. Think of it as a compiler for your infra.

---

### Step 5. Preview the Execution Plan

```bash
terraform plan
```

Shows what Terraform *would do*:

* Add, change, or delete resources.
* No changes happen yet—this is a **dry run**.

---

### Step 6. Apply the Plan

```bash
terraform apply
```

Terraform now creates your resources. You’ll be asked to confirm with **yes**.

Behind the scenes, Terraform also updates its **state file** (`terraform.tfstate`). This file keeps track of all resources Terraform manages.

---

### Step 7. Destroy Infrastructure

When you’re done testing:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

Terraform removes everything it created. This is super useful for keeping cloud costs down!

---

## 🧠 Going Deeper: Key Terraform Concepts

### 1. Variables

Instead of hardcoding values, make them dynamic:

```hcl
variable "region" {
  default = "us-east-1"
}
provider "aws" {
  region = var.region
}
```

Run with custom variables:

```bash
terraform apply -var="region=eu-west-1"
```

---

### 2. Outputs

Show useful information after deployment:

```hcl
output "bucket_name" {
  value = aws_s3_bucket.demo.bucket
}
```

View outputs:

```bash
terraform output
```

---

### 3. State Management

Terraform keeps track of what it manages in `terraform.tfstate`.

* For **teams**, store it remotely (e.g., AWS S3 + DynamoDB for locking).
* Never edit it by hand unless you *really* know what you’re doing.

---

### 4. Modules

Think of modules like **functions** in programming.
They package resources into reusable blocks.

Example:

```hcl
module "network" {
  source     = "./modules/network"
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
}
```

This lets you structure large projects cleanly.

---

### 5. Workspaces

Workspaces let you separate environments (dev, staging, prod) while reusing the same configs.

```bash
terraform workspace new dev
terraform workspace select dev
terraform apply
```

## 🛠️ Terraform Commands Cheat Sheet

Here’s your quick reference. Bookmark this!

### Initialization & Setup

```bash
terraform init          # Initialize directory (downloads providers)  
terraform validate      # Validate configuration files  
terraform fmt           # Auto-format .tf files  
terraform providers     # Show required providers  
```

### Core Workflow

```bash
terraform plan          # Preview changes (dry run)  
terraform apply         # Apply changes  
terraform destroy       # Destroy all managed infrastructure  
```

### State Management

```bash
terraform state list                    # List resources in state  
terraform state show <resource>         # Show details of a resource  
terraform state rm <resource>           # Remove a resource from state  
terraform refresh                       # Refresh local state from provider  
```

### Variables & Outputs

```bash
terraform output                        # Show outputs  
terraform apply -var="key=value"        # Pass variable at runtime  
```

### Workspaces

```bash
terraform workspace list                # List workspaces  
terraform workspace new staging         # Create new workspace  
terraform workspace select staging      # Switch to workspace  
```

### Debugging & Logs

```bash
TF_LOG=DEBUG terraform plan             # Debug logs  
TF_LOG=TRACE terraform apply            # Very detailed logs  
```

## 🎯 Final Thoughts

Terraform is a powerful tool for managing infrastructure consistently and safely. The learning curve may feel steep at first, but once you understand the **workflow (init → plan → apply → destroy)** and how state files work, it becomes second nature.

Start small (like creating a single bucket or VM), then explore **variables, modules, and remote state** as you grow more confident. And whenever you forget a command—come back to the cheat sheet above.
