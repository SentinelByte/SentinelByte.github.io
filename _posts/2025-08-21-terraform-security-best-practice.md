## 🔒 Why Terraform Security Matters

Terraform is a powerful IaC (Infrastructure as Code) tool, but misconfigurations and insecure practices can open doors to serious security breaches. From leaked credentials to over-permissive IAM roles, poor Terraform hygiene is often the root cause of cloud compromise.

This post highlights the key security best practices that I’ve implemented in real-world environments to harden Terraform usage and minimize risk.

---

## ✅ 1. Use Least Privilege IAM for Terraform

Avoid using `AdministratorAccess` for your Terraform automation or local development.

- Create specific IAM roles for each environment (e.g., `TerraformDevRole`, `TerraformProdRole`).
- Restrict permissions to only the required actions.
- Use **OIDC with GitHub Actions** to eliminate long-lived credentials.

**Tooling Tip:**  
Use [terraform-aws-iam-policy-documents](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-iam-policy-documents) to generate principle-of-least-privilege policies easily.

---

## 🔐 2. Secure Terraform State Files

Terraform’s `tfstate` contains sensitive information such as:

- Secrets
- Resource ARNs
- IP addresses
- Keys and endpoints

**Best practices:**

- Use remote state backends like **S3** with **encryption, versioning, and access control**.
- Enable **DynamoDB state locking** to prevent concurrent writes.
- Add `*.tfstate*` to `.gitignore` and never push to VCS.

---

## 🔍 3. Scan Terraform Code for Vulnerabilities

Automate security scanning of Terraform code before any deployment:

- [Checkov](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov)
- [TFSec](https://github.com/aquasecurity/tfsec)
- [KICS](https://github.com/Checkmarx/kics)

```bash
checkov -d .
````

Integrate these into your CI/CD pipeline and fail builds on high-severity findings.

## 🧪 4. Isolate Environments

Avoid deploying different environments into the same workspace or backend.

* Use **separate backends** for `dev`, `staging`, and `prod`.
* Prefix resources with environment tags: `prod-db`, `dev-vpc`.
* Use different IAM roles and security policies per environment.

---

## 🗝️ 5. Never Hardcode Secrets

Hardcoded secrets can easily leak into version control.

Instead, use:

* **Terraform variables** loaded at runtime
* **Secret managers** like AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault
* GitHub Actions/GitLab CI secrets injection (`TF_VAR_`)

---

## 📦 6. Harden Your Terraform Modules

Keep modules modular, secure, and testable:

* Validate inputs (`type`, `regex`, etc.)
* Pin module versions with tags, not `main`
* Audit third-party modules before use

---

## 👁️ 7. Review Changes Before Applying

Every `terraform apply` should go through:

* Manual or automated **`terraform plan` review**
* PR reviews with code owners or cloud security leads
* Git history with change context and reasoning

---

## 🚀 Final Thoughts

Security in Terraform isn't optional — it’s foundational. Secure state, validated inputs, and least privilege access go a long way toward building safe and scalable infrastructure.
