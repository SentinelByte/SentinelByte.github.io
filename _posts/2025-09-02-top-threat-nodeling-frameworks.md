## Introduction to Threat Modeling
Imagine you’re building a banking app. You’ve encrypted passwords, secured the database, and applied patches. But have you really thought like an attacker? What if someone tries to spoof a user, escalate privileges, or exploit an overlooked vulnerability?  

That’s where **threat modeling frameworks** come in. They give security teams structured ways to anticipate, prioritize, and mitigate threats—long before attackers exploit them. In this guide, we’ll explore the most widely used frameworks: **STRIDE, MITRE ATT&CK, PASTA, CVSS, and TMaaC.**

## What is Threat Modeling?
Threat modeling is a **structured process for identifying what can go wrong in a system** and how to defend against it.  

Think of it like architecture: when designing a building, architects consider earthquakes, fire hazards, and break-ins. In cybersecurity, we consider spoofing, denial of service, and privilege escalation.  

Different frameworks provide **different perspectives**: some focus on attacker behavior, some on risk scoring, and some on automation.

## Threat Modeling Frameworks Deep Dive

### STRIDE
- **Purpose:** Identify different categories of threats.  
- **How:** Six categories: **Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure, Denial of service, Elevation of privilege.**  
- **Best For:** Developers designing new systems.  
- **Example:** Protecting a login form from spoofing and privilege escalation.  

---

### MITRE ATT&CK
- **Purpose:** Map real-world attacker behaviors.  
- **How:** Knowledge base of **Tactics → Techniques → Procedures (TTPs).**  
- **Best For:** SOC teams, detection engineering, incident response.  
- **Example:** Mapping a phishing campaign to *Initial Access* and *Execution* tactics in the MITRE matrix.  

---

### PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis)
- **Purpose:** A risk-centric, 7-step methodology for aligning business impact with technical risks.  
- **How:** Simulates attacks, evaluates impact, and guides mitigation.  
- **Best For:** Enterprises needing a **business-aligned risk analysis.**  
- **Example:** An e-commerce site simulating SQL injection and measuring impact on revenue.  

---

### CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)
- **Purpose:** Standardize vulnerability severity scoring.  
- **How:** Scores vulnerabilities (0–10) based on exploitability, impact, and complexity.  
- **Best For:** Vulnerability management, patch prioritization.  
- **Example:** A CVSS 9.8 vulnerability → urgent patch; CVSS 3.1 → lower priority.  

---

### TMaaC (Threat Modeling as Code)
- **Purpose:** Integrate threat modeling into DevSecOps pipelines.  
- **How:** Use code (YAML/DSL) to model threats, automate checks in CI/CD.  
- **Best For:** Agile teams, cloud-native systems.  
- **Example:** Automatically generating a threat model when deploying a new microservice.

## Frameworks Comparison

| Framework   | Goal                        | Strength              | Best For          | Example Use Case              |
|-------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------|------------------|-------------------------------|
| STRIDE      | Identify threat categories  | Simple, systematic    | Developers       | Designing a login system      |
| MITRE ATT&CK| Map attacker behaviors      | Real-world focus      | SOC/Blue Teams   | Phishing detection            |
| PASTA       | Risk-based simulation       | Business alignment    | Enterprises      | E-commerce site analysis      |
| CVSS        | Score vulnerabilities       | Global standard       | Security managers| Patch prioritization          |
| TMaaC       | Automate threat modeling    | DevSecOps-friendly    | Agile teams      | CI/CD threat integration      |

## Bringing All Together
No single framework solves everything. Instead, they **complement each other**:  
- Use **STRIDE** during design.  
- Use **CVSS** to prioritize vulnerabilities.  
- Use **MITRE ATT&CK** to understand attacker behavior.  
- Use **PASTA** for business-level risk assessment.  
- Use **TMaaC** to bring it all into your DevOps pipelines.  

Together, these frameworks form a **toolbox** for thinking like an attacker, defending like a pro, and scaling security across teams.

## Conclusion
Back to our banking app—would you start with STRIDE to identify possible threats, or rely on MITRE ATT&CK to map out attacker behaviors?  

The right answer depends on context. The important thing is knowing that **frameworks exist to guide you** through the complexity of cybersecurity.  

If you’re new, start small with **STRIDE or CVSS**. As your security practice matures, explore **MITRE ATT&CK, PASTA, and TMaaC**.
